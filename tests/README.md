#CfElasticSearch test suite

The tests for *CfElasticSearch* use [MXUnit](http://mxunit.org). As such, you can use any of the MXUnit test running tools such as the Eclipse plugin or Ant test runner to run the tests. Additionally, for convenience, you can run all the tests by making them web-accessible and browsing to:
